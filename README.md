# Cozy Winter Night AI Scene

The Unity folder contains a cozy winter scene which you can explore using UnityEditor. You can explore the scene by going into play mode and move the camera in the "Scene" tab.

## Install guide

(If you don't want to explore the scene in Unity you can also look at the files in the Assets folder. The models, scripts and other files are located there.)

- This project does not contain a build therefore you need UnityEditor to be able to explore it. (Source code)
- In Unity Hub, select the "Project" tab and then choose "Open". Select "Add Project from disk."
- Navigate to the root of the git "Cozy Winter Night" folder and click open.
- The "Cozy Winter Night" Project will appear in the project list now.
- By double clicking the project it will open. Unity may ask you to install the right editor version which is necessary to be able to explore the scene

## How to use

In Unity, navigate to scenes and double click "Cozy Winter Night". Now you can explore the scene with the camera. By pressing the play button at the top the scene will play the animations (snow, materializing effect)
